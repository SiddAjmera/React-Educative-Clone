      <h1>Leadership Styles</h1>
      <p>
        Leadership styles refers to the broad approach adopted by a leader. All
        leaders (at least all those leaders who already have followers) have
        one. If you are already a leader, that includes you. You just might not
        know what it is yet. But your followers do!
      </p>
      <p>
        Style is often based on a leaderâ€™s own beliefs, personality,
        experiences, working environment and their assessment of the situation
        at the time.
